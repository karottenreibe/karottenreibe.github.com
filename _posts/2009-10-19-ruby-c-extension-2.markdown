    Continuing yesterday's post, I explore the
    subtleties of crossing the border from Ruby
    gem land to Ruby C extension land.
title: Ruby C Extensions -- Part 2
---

This is part 2 of my little tale of my adventures
in Ruby C extension land.

If you haven't read part 1,
[you might want to go back there][part1].

# The Jouney Begins... #

I started my ventures into the unknown territory of
Ruby C extension land from the small village of
Ruby gem land. I had been living there for roughly
over a year now and I wanted to see, if the world
hadn't more to offer.

So I set out to the borders of the realm known to
me, packed with a good old pure Ruby gem and nothing
more than broad band internet access.


# The crossroads #

When you travel through Ruby gem land, nothing much
exciting is coming your way. Everything is well
regulated and well documented -- there are info stands
every 2 meters.

But once you reach its border, everything gets rougher.
The mountains climb higher, the grass grows bigger and
the forests get more imprevious.

As soon as you are over the border, you find yourself
walking a narrow, shadowy path that leads directly
to a crossroads.

There you have to face a decision:

Will I go down St. ReadAllDocumentation Lane or will I
follow the faster, but much darker JustDoIt Alley?

Being a responsible programmer, I of course chose the latter...

But nonetheless I'd like to list some great sources on
the topic, just in case you're one of those whacky people
that like to read manuals:

*   [The Pickaxe][pickaxe] has some pages on C extensions.
*   [Ruby Inside][rubyinside] has a 5 minute tutorial.
*   [eqqon][] has extensive API documentation.
*   [segment7][] has some useful guidelines on C extension
    development.


Now, while you ponder on which way to go, I'll leave you
for a little time to finish the next part of this enchanting
narration...
