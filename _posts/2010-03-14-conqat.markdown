    Just a little summary of my internship that
    is currently going on.

As part of my studies, I am currently working
in a three week internship at university,
consisting of 4 tutors, 6 fellow students and me.

We are improving on the [Continuous Quality Assessment Toolkit][conqat];
or short: ConQAT.

It's a nice little open-source code quality analyzer
that works as an [Eclipse][] plugin. It comes with
HTML result generation, a very flexible pipe-like
mechanism to build analyses out of simple parts
(called processors) and a graphical editor to build
those.

Most of our work is focused on the GUI part of the
application, since the rest is already pretty rock-solid.

It's quite a lot of fun and the insight you gain into
the Eclipse architecture is quite... enlightening ;-)

As of late, I'm working on [refactoring][]s, quite an
interesting, challenging (and not at all well-documented) part of
Eclipse.

But I'm doing well so far. Quite the learning experience.
